# Fix Summary: CefSharp Architecture Mismatch Issue

## Problem
The Revit add-in was throwing two different errors:

1. **First Error**: CefSharp architecture mismatch
```
Could not load file or assembly 'CefSharp.Core.Runtime.dll' or one of its dependencies. 
An attempt was made to load a program with an incorrect format.
```

2. **Second Error**: Missing RevitInternalBrowserLib assembly
```
Could not load file or assembly 'RevitInternalBrowserLib, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.
```

The first error typically occurs when there's a mismatch between the target architecture (x86 vs x64) or when the wrong version of native dependencies is being loaded. The second error occurs when the required library DLL is not present in the add-in's output directory.

## Root Cause
1. **Incorrect CefSharp dependency copying**: The add-in project was copying CefSharp dependencies directly from the NuGet package root, which could include both x86 and x64 versions.
2. **Platform configuration mismatch**: The solution file had some projects configured for "Any CPU" instead of "x64".
3. **Build order issues**: The add-in project wasn't ensuring the Lib project (which properly handles CefSharp dependencies) was built first.
4. **Missing library DLL**: The `RevitInternalBrowserLib.dll` was not being copied to the add-in's output directory due to project reference configuration issues.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed CefSharp Dependency Copying
**File**: `RevitInternalBrowserAddin/RevitInternalBrowser.csproj`

- **Before**: Copied CefSharp files directly from NuGet package root
- **After**: Copy CefSharp files from the Lib project's output directory, which ensures the correct x64 versions are used

### 2. Added Proper CefSharp Copying to Lib Project
**File**: `RevitInternalBrowserLib/RevitInternalBrowserLib.csproj`

- Added `CopyCefSharpDependencies` target that specifically copies x64 CefSharp dependencies
- Excludes x86 versions to prevent conflicts
- Ensures only the correct architecture files are copied

### 3. Fixed Platform Configuration
**File**: `RevitInternalBrowser.sln`

- Updated all project configurations to use "x64" instead of "Any CPU"
- Added missing configuration entries for all build configurations

### 4. Improved Build Dependencies
**File**: `RevitInternalBrowserAddin/RevitInternalBrowser.csproj`

- Added `EnsureLibProjectBuilt` target to ensure the Lib project builds first
- Removed `Private=false` from the project reference to ensure the library DLL is copied
- Added explicit copy target for `RevitInternalBrowserLib.dll` to ensure it's always present

## Verification
After the fix:
- ? `CefSharp.Core.Runtime.dll` is now 2.0MB (correct x64 size)
- ? All CefSharp dependencies are present in the add-in output directory
- ? `RevitInternalBrowserLib.dll` is now present (24KB) in the add-in output directory
- ? No x86 files are present that could cause conflicts
- ? Build process ensures correct dependency order

## Testing Instructions
1. Close Revit if it's currently running
2. Build the solution using: `dotnet build RevitInternalBrowser.sln --configuration "Debug None Auth 2024"`
3. Verify that both `CefSharp.Core.Runtime.dll` (~2.0MB) and `RevitInternalBrowserLib.dll` (24KB) are present in `RevitInternalBrowserAddin\bin\Debug\None Auth\2024\`
4. Load the add-in in Revit and test the browser functionality

## Files Modified
- `RevitInternalBrowserAddin/RevitInternalBrowser.csproj`
- `RevitInternalBrowserLib/RevitInternalBrowserLib.csproj`
- `RevitInternalBrowser.sln`
- `build-and-test.ps1` (new test script)

The fix ensures that only the correct x64 CefSharp dependencies are used and that all required library DLLs are present, resolving both the architecture mismatch error and the missing assembly error.
