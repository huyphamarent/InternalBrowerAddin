# CefSharp Initialization Fix for Revit Integration

## Problem
The Revit add-in was showing a "CefSharp Initialization Error" with the message:
```
CEF can only be initialized once per process. This is a limitation of the underlying CEF/Chromium framework.
```

## Root Cause
The error occurred because:

1. **Revit initializes CefSharp itself** when it starts up
2. **CEF can only be initialized once per process** (this is a fundamental limitation of the Chromium framework)
3. **Your add-in was trying to initialize CefSharp again**, causing the conflict

## Solution
Modified the `CefSharpInitializer.Initialize()` method to check if CefSharp is already initialized before attempting to initialize it.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Added Initialization Check
**File**: `RevitInternalBrowserLib/CefSharpInitializer.cs`

```csharp
// Check if CefSharp is already initialized (by Revit)
if (Cef.IsInitialized)
{
    System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("CefSharp is already initialized by Revit. Skipping initialization.");
    _isInitialized = true;
    return;
}
```

#### 2. Modified Shutdown Behavior
**File**: `RevitInternalBrowserLib/CefSharpInitializer.cs`

```csharp
public static void Shutdown()
{
    lock (_lockObject)
    {
        // Only shutdown if we initialized it (not if Revit initialized it)
        if (_isInitialized && Cef.IsInitialized == true)
        {
            // Check if we should actually shutdown (Revit might still need it)
            // For now, we'll be conservative and not shutdown to avoid conflicts with Revit
            System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("CefSharp shutdown requested, but skipping to avoid conflicts with Revit.");
            _isInitialized = false;
        }
    }
}
```

## How It Works

### Before the Fix:
1. Revit starts and initializes CefSharp
2. Your add-in loads and tries to initialize CefSharp again
3. **Error**: "CEF can only be initialized once per process"

### After the Fix:
1. Revit starts and initializes CefSharp
2. Your add-in loads and checks `Cef.IsInitialized`
3. **Result**: Skips initialization since CefSharp is already initialized
4. **Success**: Add-in can use CefSharp without conflicts

## Benefits

1. **Eliminates initialization conflicts**: No more "CEF can only be initialized once" errors
2. **Works with Revit's CefSharp**: Uses the same CefSharp instance that Revit initialized
3. **Safe shutdown**: Doesn't interfere with Revit's CefSharp instance
4. **Proper integration**: Follows the recommended pattern for Revit add-ins using CefSharp

## Verification

### Build Status
- ? **Build succeeds** without errors
- ? **CefSharp initialization** now checks for existing initialization
- ? **Safe shutdown** prevents conflicts with Revit

### Expected Behavior
When you load the add-in in Revit:
1. **No initialization error** should appear
2. **Browser window** should open successfully
3. **CefSharp functionality** should work properly

## Important Notes

### CefSharp Version Compatibility
This fix works in conjunction with the CefSharp version fix (105.3.390) to ensure:
- **Same version** as Revit 2024
- **No initialization conflicts**
- **Proper integration** with Revit's CefSharp instance

### Debug Information
The fix includes debug output to help troubleshoot:
- `"CefSharp is already initialized by Revit. Skipping initialization."`
- `"CefSharp shutdown requested, but skipping to avoid conflicts with Revit."`

## Next Steps

1. **Close Revit** if it's currently running
2. **Test the add-in** - it should now load without initialization errors
3. **Open the browser window** - it should work properly
4. **Verify functionality** - all CefSharp features should work correctly

The initialization fix ensures that your add-in properly integrates with Revit's existing CefSharp instance, eliminating the "CEF can only be initialized once" error.
